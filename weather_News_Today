A weather pattern change next week may bring modest relief from the recent siege of massive, destructive wildfires and cloak of dense smoke across parts of Washington, Oregon and California.

As of Wednesday, over half of the 96 large wildfires burning in the West were in California, Oregon and Washington, according to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). Malden, Washington, and Phoenix, Oregon, were just two of the towns scorched.

"I've talked to people who have been in fire for 20, 30, 40+ years and they've never seen anything like this before," said NIFC fire meteorologist Nick Nauslar in a tweet Tuesday evening.
